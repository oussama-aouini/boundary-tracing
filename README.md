# Boundary tracing algorithms
 
 this repo will be containing the implementation of 
 - [Square tracing algorithm](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/downloads_V3/root_downloads/tutorials/contour_tracing_Abeer_George_Ghuneim/square.html)
 - [Moore-neighbor tracing algorithm](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/downloads_V3/root_downloads/tutorials/contour_tracing_Abeer_George_Ghuneim/moore.html)

in matlab, python and julia
I will also try to implemented with Rust and interface it with python, julia and javascript.
